  "Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension >= 10 mm (>= 1 cm) by computed tomography (CT) imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy; the CT from a combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be used if it is of diagnostic quality; laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence of disease.",

Brain metastases that were managed with first line osimertinib is permissible, provided that the brain metastases are stable on a baseline MRI and for whom radiation or surgical resection is not indicated. - The patient is asymptomatic from the brain metastases. - Corticosteroids and anti-epileptic drugs prescribed for the management of brain metastases have been discontinued at least 7 days prior to registration. - The brain metastases are stable on pre-registration imaging.",
  "Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 x 10^9/L.",
  "Hemoglobin >= 90 g/L (or >= 9 g/dL).",

  "Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) =< 470 msec.",
  "Patients must have had sufficient time between a prior therapy and resolution of toxicities from the prior therapies prior to registration as follows: - Prior EGFR inhibitor: A minimum of 7 days must have elapsed from the last dose of the prior EGFR inhibitor and resolution of any drug-related toxicity to =< grade 1 except for alopecia. - Chemotherapy: A minimum of 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose and resolution of toxicity to =< grade 1 excluding =< grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or alopecia. - Surgery: A minimum of 21 days must have elapsed following major surgery and resolution of toxicity to < grade 1 and complete wound healing must have occurred. - Radiation: A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed following radiation therapy and resolution of all radiation induced toxicity excluding alopecia. - Treatment with an investigational drug: A minimum of 3 months or five half-lives of the compound, whichever is greater, must have elapsed from last treatment date.",
