  - Able to understand and voluntarily sign the ICF and able to comply with the
    study visit schedule and the other protocol requirements.
  - Patient (male or female) >=18 years of age willing to agree to not father a
    child/become pregnant and comply with effective contraception criteria.
  - Must have progressed following standard therapy, or for whom, in the opinion
    of the Investigator, no effective standard therapy exists, is tolerated or
    is appropriate.
  - ECOG (Eastern cooperative oncology group) performance status <=2.
  - "Dose escalation part for single agent TNO155: - Advanced NSCLC harboring an
    activating EGFR mutation (e.g., exon 19 deletion, L858R, exon 20
    insertion/duplication), after progression on one or more SOC EGFR TKI (e.g.,
    gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib), per local SOC guidelines, or
    for whom no SOC EGFR-targeting TKI is available, and progression on or
    after, or intolerance to, platinum-containing combination chemotherapy. EGFR
    TKIs may include 1st through 3rd generation EGFR TKIs, as clinically
    indicated and available. EGFR TKI therapy need not be the most recent prior
    therapy. The most recent pathology report documenting the EGFR status of the
    NSCLC must be available in the patient’s source documents. - Advanced HNSCC,
    after progression on or after, or intolerance to, SOC therapy per local
    guidelines, including platinum-containing combination chemotherapy. This
    need not be the most recent prior regimen. - Advanced GIST, after
    progression on SOC therapy per local guidelines, or for whom, in the opinion
    of the Investigator, no effective standard therapy exists, is tolerated, or
    is appropriate. - Advanced KRAS G12-mutant NSCLC, after progression on or

    platinum-containing combination chemotherapy. This need not be the most
    recent prior regimen. - Advanced NRAS/BRAF WT cutaneous melanoma, after
    progression on or after, or intolerance to, SOC immuno-oncologic therapy per
    local guidelines, including anti- PD-1 therapy. NRAS and BRAF status must be
    already known for enrollment and available in the source documents."
  - "Dose expansion part for single agent TNO155: - Group 1: Advanced RAS/BRAF
    WT NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR mutation (e.g., exon 19 deletion,
    L858R, exon 20 insertion/duplication), after progression on one or more SOC
    EGFR TKI (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib), per local SOC
    guidelines, or for whom no standard-of-care EGFR-targeting TKI is available,

    EGFR TKIs, as clinically indicated and available. EGFR TKI need not be the
    most recent prior therapy. - Group 2: Advanced, RAS/BRAF WT HNSCC, after
    progression on or after, or intolerance to SOC therapy per local guidelines,
    including platinum-containing combination chemotherapy. This need not be the
    most recent prior regimen. - Group 3: Advanced RAS/BRAF WT other solid
    malignancy with documented RTKdependency. Patients must have had an
    objective response, per investigator assessment, to a single-agent,
    non-investigational RTK inhibitor as their most recent therapy, and then
    progressed. Exceptions to the above are possible on a case-by-case basis
    after documented discussion with Novartis. Patients must have progressed on
    or after, or been intolerant to, SOC therapy per local guidelines; for
    patients with NSCLC or HNSCC this must have included platinum-containing
    combination therapy and for patients with CRC this must have included a
    fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. - Group 4: Advanced RAS/BRAF
    WT other solid malignancy (excluding CRC), after progression on SOC therapy
    per local guidelines, or for whom, in the opinion of the Investigator, no
    effective standard therapy exists, is tolerated, or is appropriate. Patients
    with NSCLC or HNSCC must have progressed on or after, or been intolerant to,
    platinum-containing combination therapy Enrollment of any single
    histological type of cancer to this group will be limited to a maximum of 5
    patients; exceptions to this may be possible on a case-by-case basis after
    documented discussion with Novartis. - Group 5: Advanced KRAS G12C-mutant
    NSCLC, after progression on or after, or intolerance to, SOC per local
    guidelines including platinum-containing combination chemotherapy. This need
    not be the most recent prior regimen. - Group 6: Advanced NRAS/BRAF WT

  - "Dose escalation part for TNO155 in combination with nazartinib: - Advanced
    NSCLC harboring an EGFR TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutation (e.g., exon 19
    deletion, L858R), after progression on osimertinib or nazartinib. Other EGFR
    mutations may be considered following documented discussion and approval by
    Novartis. - Advanced NSCLC harboring an EGFR TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutation
    (e.g., exon 19 deletion, L858R), after progression on a 1st and/or 2nd
    generation EGFR TKI (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib) and which has

    therapy. Other EGFR mutations may be considered following documented
    discussion and approval by Novartis. Patients should be continuing on
    osimertinib treatment until 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment (and
    thus osimertinib may be continued during the screening period). Exceptions
    to this may be possible for patients who recently discontinued osimertinib,
    following documented discussion and agreement with Novartis. - Patients must
    be screened for HBV. Patients who are either HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA
    positive must be willing and able to take antiviral therapy 1-2 weeks prior
    to 1st dose of nazartinib treatment and continue on antiviral therapy for at
    least 4 weeks after the last dose of nazartinib. Additional management of
    the patients would be provided by a physician with expertise in management
    of HBV, if needed. - Patients must be screened for HCV. Patients must have
    negative hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) or positive HCV-Ab but undetectable
    level of HCV-RNA. Note: patients with detectable HCV-RNA are not eligible."

short_title: Dose Finding Study of TNO155 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
phase: I
protocol_no: CTNO155X2101
nct_purpose: The purpose of this first in human (FIH) trial is to characterize
  the safety and tolerability of the SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 alone and in
  combination with EGF816 (nazartinib) and identify a recommended dose for
  future studies in adult patients with advanced solid tumors in selected
  indications.
