long_title: "Canadian Profiling and Targeted Agent Utilization Trial (CAPTUR): A
  Phase II Basket Trial"
short_title: Canadian Profiling and Targeted Agent Utilization Trial (CAPTUR)
phase: II
protocol_no: PM1
nct_purpose: Recent advances in laboratory technology have enabled the
  identification of changes in the genetic makeup of tumors that might be
  responsible for their malignant behavior such as uncontrolled growth and
  spread. Some of these changes can be druggable, i.e. there may be cancer
  medicines that can specifically act on the tumour's genetic abnormality.
  Several cancer centers and programs have initiated this type of molecular
  profiling across Canada, with the goal to identify druggable changes in tumors
  to find matching therapy for patients. These include initiatives in British
  Columbia, Ontario and Quebec for adult tumours, as well as a pan-Canadian
  profiling centre for pediatrics. The CAnadian Profiling and Targeted agent
  Utilization tRial (CAPTUR) will test the activity of a list of commercially
  available targeted agents in patients who have undergone tumor profiling by
  one of the above mentioned programs, and have druggable changes identified in
  their cancers.
